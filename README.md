# Frontend-Shop

## Overview

This web app is a e-shop where user can search for html elements(button,form,footer,...) with desired style and get the source code(HTML+CSS) with one click. User can also create and save style sheets where he can save favorite css code, and also user can save favorite html elements for later use.

I used ReactsJs for building this web app due to the flexibility this JS framework can provide. This was my first ReactJs project dealing with state management. This caused in implementing some features in a different way and not following the best practices. Many features can be easily added with this scalable JS framework such as `code beautify`, `more html styled elements`, and `react styled components`.
